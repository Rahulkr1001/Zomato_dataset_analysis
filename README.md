#  Zomato Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Zomato restaurant dataset. The analysis is performed using Python and several data science libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The notebook includes the following key steps:

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The analysis begins by loading the Zomato dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, which provides a versatile and powerful structure for data manipulation and analysis. Once the data is loaded, the next step is to address any missing values. Missing values can skew analysis results, so they are identified and handled appropriatelyâ€”either by filling them with suitable values or by removing the affected rows or columns, depending on the context and extent of the missing data. Additionally, to ensure that the dataset is in a consistent and usable format, columns are converted to appropriate data types. This conversion is crucial for performing accurate computations and analyses later in the process.


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves examining several key aspects of the dataset. The distribution of restaurant ratings is analyzed to understand rating trends and overall quality. The distribution of votes is examined to gauge customer engagement and popularity, as more votes typically indicate higher interest. Additionally, an analysis of the cost for two people is conducted to understand pricing trends and categorize restaurants based on affordability, which is crucial for identifying different market segments and consumer preferences.


# Visualizations
The analysis includes several key visualizations. A histogram illustrates the distribution of restaurant ratings, highlighting overall quality and rating trends. A bar plot displays the distribution of votes received by restaurants, providing insights into customer engagement and popularity. Additionally, visual representations of the cost for two people are segmented by different categories, allowing for an understanding of pricing trends and affordability. These visualizations are crucial for identifying patterns and making data-driven decisions.


# Insights and Findings
The analysis provides several key insights. Popular cuisines are identified, highlighting which types of food attract the most customers. The top-rated restaurants are analyzed, focusing on their characteristics to understand what makes them stand out. Additionally, the geographical distribution of restaurants is examined, offering insights into location-based trends and preferences. These findings help in understanding customer behavior, identifying successful restaurant traits, and recognizing areas with high or low restaurant density.

# Conclusion
The notebook concludes with a summary of key findings and potential areas for further analysis.
